# Quandam
This project generates a REST Interface depending on a given Database Structure for PHP based projects.

# Why does this project exist?
Many projects start by creating a data structure (e.g. MySQL Database) and developing an REST interface for CRUD operations on top of it. 
With Quandam, a given Database Structure will be used to generate a complete REST Interface for it.
